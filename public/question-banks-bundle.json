What is the most appropriate approach to achieve this granular permission structure?","options":["A) Disable derived permissions globally and manually assign View and Overwrite capabilities to individual users for each external asset","B) Create separate projects for sensitive and non-sensitive data sources, then use project-based permission inheritance with selective explicit permission overrides for compliance teams","C) Enable obfuscation for all lineage data and rely on role-based access control through Tableau Server groups","D) Use the Metadata API to programmatically filter sensitive information before it's indexed by Catalog"],"correctAnswer":"B","explanation":"The most scalable and maintainable approach for enterprise environments is to leverage project-based organization with selective overrides. This allows you to use Tableau's hierarchical permission model effectively while maintaining granular control where needed. Option B provides the best balance of automation (through derived permissions within projects) and control (through explicit overrides for sensitive data). Option A would be too manual and difficult to maintain at scale. Option C doesn't provide the required granularity. Option D is not how Catalog permissions work - filtering must be done through the permission system, not the API.","topic":"Metadata Permissions and Enterprise Governance","difficulty":"Advanced"},{"id":"tc_002","question":"A multinational corporation is experiencing performance issues with Tableau Catalog indexing, frequently seeing 'Showing partial results' messages. The organization has over 50,000 workbooks across multiple sites and complex data source relationships.

When a tiled object is hidden, the results depend on its level in the layout hierarchy: in a Horizontal or Vertical layout container, hidden objects have their space filled in by other objects in the container. However, in the Tiled layout container at the very top of the layout hierarchy, a hidden object leaves blank space behind.

This affects initial publishing, extract refreshes, changing site encryption modes, and key rotation. Additionally, there's a slight increase in viz load time for the first user loading a workbook (data must be decrypted from disk to memory).

FIXED LOD calculations can sometimes be performed by database; Tableau Prep supports FIXED LOD and rank calculations. Date functions have significant performance impact - consider DATEPARSE and MAKEDATE, use built-in functions like DATEDIFF() when possible.

If you can't clearly state what a row represents, the data might be structured poorly for analysis. This is also why TableName(Count) should always be checked when working with new data.","difficulty":"beginner","tags":["granularity","data-structure","level-of-detail","row-definition","analysis"]},{"id":"10","question":"What factors limit the benefits of using related tables in Tableau's data model?","options":["Related tables always perform better than joins with no limitations","Dirty data, data source filters, tables with many unmatched values, and (in versions before 2024.2) interrelating multiple fact tables with multiple dimension tables","Related tables can only be used with Tableau Server, not Desktop","The number of tables is limited to exactly three"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"Several factors can limit the benefits of relationships: (1) Dirty data/poorly structured tables that mix measures and dimensions, (2) Data source filters that limit Tableau's ability to do join culling, (3) Tables with many unmatched values across relationships, and (4) In versions 2020.2-2024.1, interrelating multiple fact tables with multiple dimension tables (shared/conformed dimensions).

What works for one workbook may not work for another, so it's essential to test optimizations in your specific environment with your actual data and use cases. While the other options are performance recommendations, they are not universally applicable principles.","difficulty":"BEGINNER","tags":["performance-principles","optimization-approach"]},{"id":"2","question":"Which filtering strategy is recommended as the first priority in the performance optimization hierarchy?","options":["Dashboard filters with \"Apply\" buttons enabled","Context filters on dimensions with high cardinality","Extract and data source filters","Quick filters with multi-select dropdown functionality"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Extract and data source filters are the highest priority in the filtering hierarchy because they reduce the data volume before any visualization processing occurs. These filters are applied at the data source level, meaning less data needs to be processed throughout the entire workbook. Dashboard filters, context filters, and quick filters all operate after the data has already been loaded and processed.","difficulty":"INTERMEDIATE","tags":["filtering-strategy","data-source-optimization"]},{"id":"3","question":"When optimizing calculations for performance, which data types should be prioritized over others?","options":["Strings and text fields for better readability","Date and datetime fields for temporal analysis","Booleans and integers for faster processing","Floating point numbers for precision calculations"],"correctAnswer":2,"explanation":"Booleans and integers should be prioritized because they require less memory and processing power compared to strings, dates, or floating-point numbers. Boolean calculations are particularly fast as they involve simple true/false evaluations, while integers are more efficient than decimal numbers or text-based operations. This is a key recommendation in Tableau's performance checklist for calculation optimization.","difficulty":"BEGINNER","tags":["calculation-optimization","data-types"]},{"id":"4","question":"Your company's sales dashboard contains 15 worksheets with live connections to a SQL Server database.

If metrics use different scales (e.g., one from 0-10 and another from 0-1000), the chart will be visually misleading. While using the same data source is helpful, it's not strictly required.

Without normalization, the sales volume (with values in hundreds of thousands) would dominate the visualization, making other metrics appear insignificant. Creating calculated fields that convert all metrics to a 0-100 scale or similar ensures that each dimension contributes equally to the visual comparison.

When filters change the underlying dataset, the calculations for X and Y coordinates (using sine and cosine functions) must still maintain proper axis positioning and scaling. If not handled correctly, filtering could cause vertices to appear in wrong positions or the chart to become distorted.

This maintains both security compliance and visualization accuracy. If RLS filters are applied after coordinate calculations, the positioning might be based on unauthorized data, creating misleading visualizations.

When filters drastically reduce data points, the calculations may lose reference points needed for proper positioning. Using FIXED LOD expressions ensures that the coordinate calculations have access to the necessary data regardless of filter context, maintaining chart structure.

The features are related through this daily limit constraint.","difficulty":"Advanced","tags":["view-acceleration","data-freshness-policy","limitations","integration"]},{"id":"13","question":"Custom views that haven't been accessed in how many days will NOT be accelerated?","options":["7 days","14 days","30 days","90 days"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"Custom views that haven't been accessed in 14 days will not be accelerated. This helps optimize resource usage by focusing acceleration on actively used content rather than abandoned or rarely accessed views. This automatic cleanup prevents wasted computation on content that users aren't viewing.","difficulty":"Beginner","tags":["view-acceleration","usage-tracking","automatic-cleanup"]},{"id":"14","question":"Your organization needs to implement View Acceleration across multiple sites with different performance requirements. Site A has critical real-time dashboards, Site B has analytical workbooks refreshed daily, and Site C has development workbooks. How should acceleration be configured?","options":["Enable acceleration on all sites with identical settings for consistency","Enable acceleration only on Site B, avoid on Sites A and C for different reasons","Enable acceleration on Sites A and B but with different refresh policies","Disable acceleration entirely to avoid complexity"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"Site B (analytical workbooks refreshed daily) is ideal for View Acceleration as these are stable, consumption-focused workbooks. Site A should avoid acceleration because real-time requirements conflict with the precomputation model and 12-job daily limits. Site C should avoid acceleration because development workbooks are frequently republished, triggering unnecessary precomputation. Each site's use case determines the appropriate strategy.","difficulty":"Advanced","tags":["view-acceleration","multi-site","enterprise-strategy","use-case-analysis"]}]},"work-with-content-revisions":{"title":"Work with Content Revisions","description":"Master revision history management for workbooks, data sources, and virtual connections including version control, restoration workflows, permission requirements, and potential issues with data changes and ownership.","metadata":{"domain":"Domain 4: Establish Governance and Support Published Content","certification":"Tableau Consultant","totalQuestions":8,"estimatedTime":"12 minutes","difficulty":"intermediate"},"questions":[{"id":1,"question":"What site roles and permissions are required to access revision history for workbooks?","options":["Any site role with View permission on the workbook","Creator or Explorer (Can Publish) site role; View, Save, and Download Workbook/Save As permissions on workbooks; View and Save on project","Administrator role only; no other permissions needed","Viewer role with Download permission"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"To access revision history, you must have a CREATOR or EXPLORER (CAN PUBLISH) site role, PLUS the following permissions: PROJECT—View and Save; WORKBOOKS in the project—View, Save, and Download Workbook/Save As.

To create a new revision: In Tableau Desktop, click Server > Publish Workbook or Publish Data Source, make changes, then publish again to the SAME PROJECT with the SAME NAME.

To restore the extract: (1) Navigate to the data source's revision history, (2) Download the revision (in .TDSX format) from the actions menu, (3) Open it in Tableau Desktop, (4) REPUBLISH it with the same name to the same location (confirming overwrite).
