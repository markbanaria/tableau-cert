      "question": "Starting with Tableau Server version 2023.1.0, what driver must be installed to use the built-in administrative views?",
      "options": [
        "Oracle JDBC driver",
        "SQL Server ODBC driver",
        "PostgreSQL driver",
        "MySQL connector"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Beginning with version 2023.1.0, you must install the POSTGRESQL DRIVER to use built-in administrative views. The driver can be found on the Driver Download page. IMPORTANT: If upgrading in place, your existing driver will continue to work (no need to install new driver, but recommended for most up-to-date version). If installing a fresh Tableau Server instance, you MUST download and install the driver.",

      "question": "Where can you access administrative views on Tableau Server?",
      "options": [
        "Only through the TSM (Tableau Services Manager) command line",
        "Click the Status page; site administrators see views for their site, server administrators can see entire server or individual sites",
        "Administrative views are only available via REST API",
        "Through the Data Management Add-on interface only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "To see administrative views, click STATUS. SITE ADMINISTRATORS can see administrative views for THEIR SITE. On multi-site servers: SITE ADMINISTRATORS can see views for their current site. SERVER ADMINISTRATORS can see views for the ENTIRE SERVER (click site menu > 'Manage All Sites' to access server menus), OR views for INDIVIDUAL SITES (click site menu > select site name > 'Site Status').",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Administrative views are POWERFUL MONITORING TOOLS that help you: (1) OPTIMIZE TABLEAU SERVER performance and resource utilization, and (2) Better UNDERSTAND HOW USERS ARE INTERACTING with Tableau content. These embedded Tableau workbooks monitor different types of server or site activity, providing insights into usage patterns, performance bottlenecks, and operational health.",

        "'Desktop License Usage' and 'Login-based License Usage'"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Performance-focused administrative views include: PERFORMANCE OF VIEWS—monitor view rendering performance, PERFORMANCE OF FLOW RUNS—track Tableau Prep flow execution, STATS FOR LOAD TIMES—analyze how quickly content loads.

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Usage pattern and user activity views include: TRAFFIC TO VIEWS—which views are most accessed, TRAFFIC TO DATA SOURCES—data source usage patterns, ACTIONS BY ALL USERS—server-wide user activity, ACTIONS BY SPECIFIC USER—individual user's activity tracking, ACTIONS BY RECENT USERS—activity from recent users. These help understand content popularity and user engagement.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Background task monitoring views include: BACKGROUND TASKS FOR EXTRACTS—monitor extract refresh jobs, BACKGROUND TASKS FOR NON EXTRACTS—track subscription emails and other non-extract jobs, BACKGROUND TASK DELAY—identify bottlenecks and delays in task execution, BACKGROUNDER DASHBOARD—comprehensive view of backgrounder process health. These are critical for ensuring scheduled tasks complete successfully.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Resource utilization views include: SERVER DISK SPACE—monitor disk usage across all server nodes for capacity planning, STATS FOR SPACE USAGE—analyze which content consumes the most space (workbooks, extracts, data sources). These views help administrators proactively manage storage capacity and identify opportunities for cleanup or expansion.",

      "explanation": "License management views include: LOGIN-BASED LICENSE USAGE—track consumption of login-based (user-based) licenses, DESKTOP LICENSE USAGE—monitor Tableau Desktop license utilization, DESKTOP LICENSE EXPIRATION—identify licenses approaching expiration. These views help optimize license allocation and plan for renewals or adjustments.",

        "'Performance of Views'"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The STALE CONTENT administrative view helps identify content that hasn't been accessed recently. This is valuable for: (1) Content cleanup and archiving decisions, (2) Identifying unused workbooks/data sources consuming resources, (3) Governance and lifecycle management of published content. Stale content analysis helps optimize server resources and maintain a curated content library.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Yes, administrators can CREATE CUSTOM ADMINISTRATIVE VIEWS by connecting to the PostgreSQL repository database that stores Tableau Server metadata.
