      "question": "What is the primary issue with referencing the same calculated field multiple times within another calculation?",
      "options": [
        "It causes syntax errors in Tableau",
        "It performs the calculation multiple times for each record, impacting performance",
        "It creates circular references that break the calculation",
        "It prevents the calculation from being published to Tableau Server"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When a calculation references another calculated field multiple times, it performs that calculation multiple times for each record in the dataset, significantly impacting performance. The solution is to reference the field only once or restructure the logic.",

    {
      "id": "2",
      "question": "In an enterprise environment, you need to optimize a calculation with multiple equality comparisons like IF [Field] = 'A' THEN 1 ELSEIF [Field] = 'B' THEN 2... Which approach provides the best performance?",
      "options": [
        "Keep the nested IF statements for clarity",
        "Convert to a CASE expression",
        "Use multiple IIF functions",
        "Create separate calculated fields for each condition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "CASE expressions are optimized in Tableau's query pipeline and provide better performance than nested IF statements for multiple equality comparisons. They're also more readable and maintainable.",

        "COUNTD (Count Distinct) functions",
        "MIN and MAX functions",
        "Basic arithmetic operations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "COUNTD is one of the slowest function types in Tableau and should be avoided when possible. Consider alternatives like using LOD expressions or pre-aggregating distinct counts at the data source level.",

      "options": [
        "Sets should never be used in any calculations",
        "When you need to group data; use groups or calculated fields instead",
        "Only when working with date fields",
        "Sets are always preferred over calculated fields"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Sets are meant for comparisons, not for grouping data. When you need to group data, use groups or calculated fields instead of sets for better performance and clarity.",

      "question": "In enterprise Tableau deployments, what is considered a governance best practice for calculation documentation?",
      "options": [
        "Document calculations in external Word documents",
        "Use Tableau's built-in description fields for calculations and publish to version-controlled environments",
        "Only document complex calculations",
        "Documentation is not necessary for calculations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Using Tableau's built-in description fields and maintaining version control ensures calculations are properly documented and manageable as the analytics content library grows. This is crucial for enterprise governance.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "If a table calculation is performing badly, try expressing it as a LOD expression, and vice versa. Different calculation types have different performance characteristics depending on the specific use case.",

        "Always break calculations into many small components",
        "Consider nested components for troubleshooting ease, but evaluate pushing components back to the data source for performance",
        "Use only basic functions to avoid complexity"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Complex calculations can be written as single expressions or nested components. Nested components aid troubleshooting and maintenance but may add processing overhead. Consider pushing components to the data source level for better performance.",
