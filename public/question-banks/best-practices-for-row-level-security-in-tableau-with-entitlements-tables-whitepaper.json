      "id": "2",
      "question": "In a large enterprise with 50,000 users and complex hierarchical permissions, which entitlement table optimization strategy provides the most significant performance improvement?",
      "options": [
        "Creating separate entitlement tables for each department",
        "Implementing role-based entitlements with user-to-role mapping",
        "Using direct user-to-permission mapping for granular control",
        "Storing all permissions as concatenated strings in single fields"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Role-based entitlements with user-to-role mapping provides the most significant performance improvement for large enterprises. This approach reduces the total number of entitlement records by grouping similar permissions into roles, simplifying join operations and reducing memory requirements. It also improves maintainability by allowing permission changes at the role level rather than individual user level.",

        "Implementing the filter-then-join query execution pattern",
        "Using identical column names across all security-related tables",
        "Storing entitlement data in the same database as fact data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Implementing the filter-then-join query execution pattern is critical for optimal performance. This pattern ensures that security filtering occurs before table joins, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed in subsequent operations. This prevents data multiplication and improves query performance, especially when dealing with large fact tables and complex entitlement structures.",

      "question": "What is the recommended strategy for handling temporal security requirements in entitlement table design (e.g., time-based access permissions)?",
      "options": [
        "Create separate entitlement tables for each time period",
        "Add effective date and expiration date columns to entitlement records",
        "Implement application-level logic to filter based on current time",
        "Use database triggers to automatically update permissions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Adding effective date and expiration date columns to entitlement records is the recommended approach for temporal security. This design enables database-level filtering based on current timestamp, ensuring that expired permissions are automatically excluded from query results. This approach maintains data history, supports auditing requirements, and allows for future-dated permission assignments.",

      "options": [
        "Index all columns in the entitlement table for comprehensive coverage",
        "Create composite indexes on username and permission key columns",
        "Use clustered indexes only on primary key columns",
        "Implement full-text indexes for flexible permission searches"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Creating composite indexes on username and permission key columns is most effective for security query performance. These columns are consistently used together in WHERE clauses for security filtering operations. Composite indexes optimize the typical lookup pattern where the system retrieves permissions for a specific user, providing the best performance for the most common security query patterns.",
