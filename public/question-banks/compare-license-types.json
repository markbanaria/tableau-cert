      "question": "What is the primary difference between Creator and Explorer licenses in Tableau?",
      "options": [
        "Creator includes Tableau Desktop and Prep, while Explorer is web-based only",
        "Creator is more expensive but has the same functionality as Explorer",
        "Explorer can create new data connections, while Creator cannot",
        "Creator is only for administrators, while Explorer is for end users"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Creator licenses include access to Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep for deep data preparation and analysis, while Explorer licenses are limited to web-based authoring using published data sources.",

      "question": "An enterprise client with 500 users wants to optimize their Tableau licensing costs. Most users only need to view dashboards and download summary data. What licensing strategy would be most cost-effective?",
      "options": [
        "Purchase 500 Creator licenses to ensure maximum flexibility",
        "Use a mix of Creator, Explorer, and Viewer licenses based on user roles and needs",
        "Purchase only Explorer licenses since they're the middle tier",
        "Start with Viewer licenses and upgrade everyone to Creator as needed"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A mixed licensing approach is most cost-effective. Since 60-70% of users typically only need viewing capabilities, using primarily Viewer licenses ($15/month) with selective Creator and Explorer licenses optimizes costs while meeting user needs.",

        "Equal numbers of Creator and Explorer licenses"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,

      "question": "In a cost optimization scenario, you discover that 60% of your Creator license users only view dashboards and never create new content. What action should you take?",

        "Creator for managers, Viewer for everyone else"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Both Tableau Cloud and Tableau Server use the same three license types (Creator, Explorer, Viewer) with identical user capabilities. The choice between Cloud and Server is primarily about deployment model (hosted vs self-hosted) rather than licensing differences.",
