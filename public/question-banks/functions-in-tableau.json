    },
    {
      "id": "8",
      "question": "In enterprise security implementations, when would you use USERATTRIBUTE() instead of ISMEMBEROF() for row-level security?",
      "options": [
        "When users belong to multiple groups",
        "When security attributes are dynamically assigned through JWT tokens",
        "When working with Tableau Server only",
        "When implementing column-level security"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "USERATTRIBUTE() is used when security attributes are dynamically passed through authentication workflows (like JWT tokens in embedded scenarios), allowing for more flexible, context-aware security. ISMEMBEROF() works with static group memberships, while USERATTRIBUTE() supports dynamic attribute-based access control.",
      "difficulty": "Advanced",

        "The function requires administrator permissions to execute"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "USERNAME() should be implemented as a data source filter rather than a worksheet filter for security reasons. Data source filters are applied before data reaches the workbook, making them more secure. Worksheet filters can potentially be modified or removed by users with appropriate permissions, compromising security.",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate",
      "tags": ["user-functions", "security", "data-source-filters", "username"]
    },
    {

        "PERCENTILE functions to compare distributions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "CORR([Promo Spend], [Sales Lift]) directly calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient, which is the standard statistical measure for linear relationships. When properly grouped by product categories, this provides the most accurate and interpretable measure of correlation between promotional spending and sales performance.",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate",
      "tags": ["aggregate-functions", "correlation", "statistical-analysis", "promotional-analysis"]
    },
    {

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Statistical process control requires AVG() for the center line, STDEV() for calculating upper and lower control limits (typically ±3 standard deviations), and MIN()/MAX() for range calculations. These functions together provide the foundation for SPC charts and process capability analysis.",
      "difficulty": "Advanced",
      "tags": ["aggregate-functions", "statistical-process-control", "manufacturing", "control-limits"]
    },
    {

        "INDEX() and SIZE() functions to manually calculate running totals"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "RUNNING_SUM(SUM([Sales])) partitioned by both Region and Fiscal Quarter ensures the running total calculation restarts for each unique combination of region and fiscal quarter. This partitioning strategy creates separate calculation scopes for each region-quarter combination, achieving the required restart behavior.",
      "difficulty": "Advanced",
      "tags": ["table-calculations", "running-totals", "partitioning", "fiscal-quarters"]
    },

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "WINDOW_PERCENTILE() is used when you need to calculate percentiles within specific row ranges or moving windows, such as the 90th percentile of the last 12 months of data. This table calculation allows for dynamic window definitions using FIRST()+n and LAST()-n offsets, providing more flexibility than aggregate PERCENTILE().",
      "difficulty": "Advanced",
      "tags": ["table-calculations", "percentiles", "moving-windows", "advanced-analytics"]
    },
    {
      "id": "14",

        "INDEX() function for simple sequential numbering"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "RANK_PERCENTILE() provides the most meaningful business insights for cohort analysis as it shows each customer's relative position within their cohort as a percentage (0-1). This makes it easy to identify top 10% performers regardless of cohort size and enables consistent comparison across different cohorts.",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate",
      "tags": ["table-calculations", "ranking", "cohort-analysis", "customer-analytics"]
    },

        "AVG() aggregate function",
        "LOOKUP() function to manually calculate averages"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "WINDOW_AVG() with LAST(-n) and LAST(0) parameters allows for dynamic window sizing in moving averages. For example, WINDOW_AVG(SUM([Sales]), LAST(-11), LAST(0)) creates a 12-period moving average. This approach provides flexibility to adjust window sizes based on business requirements or data availability.",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate",
      "tags": ["table-calculations", "moving-averages", "time-series", "forecasting"]

        "Use INT() function for all numeric conversions",
        "Implement IF ISNUMBER() THEN FLOAT() ELSE 0 END logic"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "IF ISNUMBER() THEN FLOAT() ELSE 0 END provides the most robust approach by first checking if the string can be converted to a number using ISNUMBER(), then converting with FLOAT() for successful cases, and providing a default value (0) for failed conversions. This prevents errors and handles edge cases gracefully.",
      "difficulty": "Intermediate",
      "tags": ["type-conversion", "error-handling", "data-quality", "float-conversion"]
