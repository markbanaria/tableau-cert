      "tags": ["data-blending", "optimization", "join-relationships"]
    },
    {
      "id": "11",
      "question": "What does it indicate when a performance recording shows high 'Elapsed Time' but low 'CPU' usage for specific operations?",
      "options": [
        "The server is overloaded with too many concurrent users",
        "Operations are likely waiting for I/O operations like database queries or network requests",
        "The workbook calculations are too complex for the available CPU",
        "Memory allocation is insufficient for the current workload"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "High Elapsed Time with low CPU usage typically indicates that operations are waiting for I/O operations such as database queries, network requests, or disk reads. The CPU isn't actively processing because it's waiting for external resources to respond.",
      "difficulty": "ADVANCED",
      "tags": ["elapsed-time-analysis", "io-operations", "performance-metrics"]
    },
    {
      "id": "12",
      "question": "When integrating performance recording analysis with view acceleration strategies, what is the key consideration for determining acceleration eligibility?",
      "options": [
        "Views must have consistent user access patterns and embedded credentials",
        "Views must use only live data source connections",
        "Views must contain fewer than 10 filters to be eligible",
        "Views must be published by server administrators only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "View acceleration requires consistent user access patterns to be effective and embedded data source credentials for automated precomputation. Views with user-based functions or inconsistent access patterns aren't suitable for acceleration.",
