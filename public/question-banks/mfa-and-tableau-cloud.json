      "explanation": "MFA authentication became a Tableau Cloud REQUIREMENT beginning FEBRUARY 1, 2022. As part of the broader Salesforce ecosystem, site owners must configure account security mechanisms. To meet the MFA requirement: (1) RECOMMENDED METHOD—SSO with MFA: Use your organization's SSO IdP with MFA; configure site to use Google, Salesforce, or SAML provider with MFA; (2) ALTERNATIVE METHOD—Tableau with MFA: If you don't work directly with an SSO IdP or if you use TableauID, enable MFA with Tableau authentication.",

        "Admin accounts are exempt from MFA requirements"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Best practices for site admin accounts: (1) Register a MINIMUM OF TWO VERIFICATION METHODS—For each site admin account, register at least two verification methods to reduce the risk of being locked out. After registering a primary method, add the RECOVERY CODES option to generate backup codes; (2) Designate at least ONE SITE ADMIN ACCOUNT to manage users and MFA—Designate at least one site admin-level account (Site Administrator Creator or Site Administrator Explorer) that has permissions to manage users and MFA settings. This redundancy helps prevent admin access delays if another admin is locked out.",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "RECOVERY CODES are to be used in EMERGENCY CASES ONLY to help reduce the risk of a locked-out scenario. When you add the Recovery Codes option, a list of TEN ONE-TIME USE codes are generated that you can use to sign in to Tableau Cloud if you don't have access to your usual MFA verification methods. CRITICAL: (1) Because the list of codes ISN'T ACCESSIBLE after adding the Recovery Codes option, IMMEDIATELY COPY AND STORE these codes in a SAFE AND SECURE LOCATION; (2) Recovery codes are NOT INTENDED to be a primary verification method—they should be used as BACKUP ONLY for emergencies.",

      "explanation": "To enable site access for a locked-out user, reset MFA verification methods: (1) Sign in to Tableau Cloud as a site admin; (2) Navigate to the Users page and select the user; (3) Click Actions menu, select 'Reset MFA Verifiers'; (4) On user's profile Settings tab, click 'Reset MFA Verifiers' button (must have 'Tableau with MFA' authentication). IMPORTANT LIMITATION: For security purposes, a site admin can ONLY RESET MFA VERIFIERS of a user that belongs to a SINGLE SITE. However, if you're also a CLOUD ADMIN, you can use TABLEAU CLOUD MANAGER (TCM) to reset verification methods of users on MULTIPLE SITES. After reset, user must register for MFA again.",
